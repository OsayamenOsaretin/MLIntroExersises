Machine Learning exercises - Coursera  https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

Machine Learning by Andrew Ng of Stanford University takes beginners through the rudimentary aspects of Machine Learning
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines all up to Neural Networks

Taking this course, I worked through the exercises and this Repo holds solutions to those exercises. 

NB: I don't claim ownership of any of the course material, and only store my solutions here as a reference for myself.
    If you're taking this course, please work through the exercises yourself, else, what's the point?
